### Digital Health & Disease Surveillance System for Migrant Workers in Kerala

Jeevan Rakshak is a smart public-health platform designed to **prevent the spread of contagious diseases among migrant workers in Kerala**.  
It bridges the gap between **migrant workers, contractors, employers, and government health authorities** through a unified digital system.

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Kerala hosts a large migrant workforce that often lacks continuous and accessible health records.  
Due to frequent movement, shared accommodations, and limited tracking, **contagious diseases can spread silently**, posing serious public-health risks.

Traditional health systems struggle with:
- Fragmented medical records  
- No real-time disease surveillance  
- Delayed outbreak detection  
- Poor contact tracing among migrant communities

- Migrant workers receive a **portable digital health identity**
- Contractors and employers manage worker onboarding responsibly
- Doctors record screenings and diagnoses digitally
